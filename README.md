This is the Python_Challenge Assignment

For the PyBank portion, we analyze budget data using variables and calculations through for loops and if statements.  The script computes ample information, including total months, total money, average change per month, and pulls the greatest increase and decrease amongst the months studied.

For the PyPoll portion, we analyze election data using variables, a list, a dictionary and calculations through for loops and if statements.  The script computes the vote count for each candidate, the vote percentage for each candidate and the winning candidate based on the vote counts.
